This repository contains the simulator tools that have been used in [1]. Please, if you are going to use any of these simulators, you have to cite the paper.

We have a more comperhansive Simpy simulator for LoRa than LoRaSim, which considers a packet error model, the imperfect orthogonality of spreading factors, the fading impact, and the duty cycle limitation at both, the devices and the gateway. Moreover, the new simulator supports bidirectional communication by adding the downlink capability and the retransmission strategy in case of confirmable uplink transmissions. Furthermore, we extended the energy consumption profile from LoRaSim to consider the consumed energy at the reception time. In additions to that you will find a simulator for the synchronized transmissions schedule based on the work in [1].
